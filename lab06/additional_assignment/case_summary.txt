File and directory permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files. If permissions are set incorrectly, they can create serious security risks. For example, files or directories with permissions 777 can be modified by anyone, sensitive files like /etc/shadow may be exposed, system scripts writable by all can be altered for malicious purposes, web server directories with wide access can allow file uploads, setuid binaries can be exploited for root access, and backup files open to all can leak sensitive data.
Permission auditing involves regularly checking file and directory permissions to find and fix risky settings. It helps reduce vulnerabilities, ensures compliance with security policies, and identifies outdated or insecure files. The principle of least privilege means giving users and processes only the permissions they need. This limits damage from mistakes or attacks, prevents privilege escalation, protects data, and makes the system more secure overall.
