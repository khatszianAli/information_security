In macOS, file permissions control access for the owner, group, and others. Group membership is key for collaboration without giving 
global access. Using setgid on shared directories ensures new files inherit the group, while umask sets default permissions—umask 002 
allows group members to write. ACLs provide finer control when standard permissions aren’t enough. Users not in the group cannot write, 
ensuring isolation. Best practices include using group ownership with setgid, setting umask 002 for collaborators, creating per-project
groups, using ACLs for exceptions, and regularly auditing permissions and group membership.
